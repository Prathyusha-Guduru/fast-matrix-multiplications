# fast-matrix-multiplications
A repo containing different strategies and tools to compute fast matrix-matrix and matrix-vector products



Possible methods we will explore: 

1. Strassen
2. Open-BLAS
3. Multithreading with BLAS in rust
4. Syncthreads in rust
5. Numba in python
6. Pytorch tensor's mat_mul
7. CUDA programming
